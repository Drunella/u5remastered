Tools for reverse-engineering C64 programs
-------------------------------------------

If you want to play Ultima 5 in a C64 emulator, I suggest you use VICE:
http://www.viceteam.org/

VICE comes with c1541, a utility for manipulating C64 disk images. You can
use it to extract the Ultima 5 savegame files.


General Information
-------------------

Ultima 5 saves the game on the Britannia disk.
More specifically, the game is saved in these files:
- prty.data
- roster
- and probably others

Numbers are usually stored as BCD's.
The high nibble contains the 10's, the low nibble contains the 1's.
In 2-byte BCD's, the low byte contains the 1000's and 100's, the high byte
contains the 10's and 1's.
The game doesn't store all numbers as BCD's. If a number isn't meant to be
displayed, the game stores it as a binary number.

                    per dungeon)
0x3D0       ?


--- Character Names ---

Character names have a maximum length of 8 chars.
The chars are stored in ASCII format.
All chars also have bit 0x80 set, except for the last one.
If the name is shorter than 8 chars, it is padded with zeroes to make it
8 bytes long.

--- Character Stats ---

0x0         1       inn/party
0x1         1       gender (0x3E = male, 0x3D = female)
0x2         1       class (upper-case ASCII char, bit 0x80 set)
0x3         1       status (upper-case ASCII char, bit 0x80 set)
0x4         1       strength
0x5         1       dexterity
0x6         1       intelligence
0x7         1       current mp
0x8         2       current hp
0xA         2       maximum hp
0xC         2       exp points
0xE         1       level
0xF         1       ?

--- Character Slots ---

Unlike the DOS version, the C64 version doesn't assign a fixed slot to each
body part.
If you ready a piece of equipment, the C64 version simply puts it in the
next free slot. Non-empty slots don't have to be contiguous.
